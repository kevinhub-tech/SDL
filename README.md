### Project Description
SDLC project was mainly researched on the topics of how a software development has variation towards the process of it. While researching through the software development life cycle, the project has introduced the taste of one of the framework from Java which is Struts. The project scenario was to 

- To create a portal where users can login to portal and get the confirmation page
- Critically analyze the process of development accordingly to the project 
- And choose a suitable type of development and implement the project

### Language and application usage
- Struts 2
- Eclipse IDE
- LucidChart
- MySQL Workbench
- Axure RP

### What I have done
Most of the duration of the project was spent in learning about the software development lifecycle and how a software development can be developed in a particular manner. Here's my outcomes after the research.

- Developed a step-by-step waterfall business model to create a portal 
- Evaluated possible risks and the solutions
- Implemented a prototype of the portal
- Developed a login function where the user will get confirmation page on the time of their full registeration

In this project, the function that has been developed worked functionally and the rest of the portal was not developed due to time availability of the course.
